# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of my internship at CODSOFT. It focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived or not using features like age, sex, class, fare, and more.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used is a CSV file containing passenger information.
- File: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📈 Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature selection
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding survival distribution by gender, class, age, etc.
3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## ✅ Results
- The best model achieved satisfactory accuracy in predicting survival.
- Visualizations helped understand important patterns like:
  - Females had higher survival rates.
  - 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
